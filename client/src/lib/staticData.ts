# 10 Signs Your Home Needs Better Insulation

Your home's insulation plays a crucial role in maintaining comfort and energy efficiency. Here are the top signs that indicate it's time for an upgrade:

## 1. Fluctuating Indoor Temperatures
If you notice significant temperature variations between rooms or floors, your insulation may be inadequate.

## 2. High Energy Bills
Unexplained spikes in heating and cooling costs often indicate poor insulation performance.

## 3. Ice Dams in Winter
Ice dams on your roof suggest heat is escaping through inadequate attic insulation.

## 4. Drafts and Cold Spots
Feeling drafts near windows, doors, or walls indicates air leaks that proper insulation can seal.

## 5. Pest Infestations
Gaps in insulation can provide entry points for rodents and insects.
